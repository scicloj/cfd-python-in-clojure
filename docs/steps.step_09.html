<p><link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.10/dist/katex.min.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"> In the previous step, we solved the 2D Burgers’ equation: an important equation in the study of fluid mechanics because it contains the full convective nonlinearity of the flow equations. With that exercise, we also build the experience to incrementally code a Navier-Stokes solver.</p>
<p>In the next two steps, we will solve Laplace and then Poisson equation. We will then put it all together!</p>
<p>Here is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_equation">Laplace’s equation</a> in 2D:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial ^2 p}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial ^2 p}{\partial y^2} = 0\]</span></p>
<p>We know how to discretize a 2nd order derivative. But this about this for a minute - Laplace’s equation has the features typical of diffusion phenomena. For this reason, it has to be discretized with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_differencing_scheme">central differences</a>, so that the discretization is consistent with the physics we want to simulate.</p>
<p>The discretized equation is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{p_{i+1, j}^n - 2p_{i,j}^n + p_{i-1,j}^n}{\Delta x^2} + \frac{p_{i,j+1}^n - 2p_{i,j}^n + p_{i, j-1}^n}{\Delta y^2} = 0\]</span></p>
<p>Notice that the Laplace Equation does not have a time dependence - there is no <span class="math inline">\(p^{n+1}\)</span>. Instead of tracking a wave through time (like in the previous steps), the Laplace equation calculates the equilibrium state of a system under the supplied boundary conditions.</p>
<p>If you have taken coursework in Heat Transfer, you will recognize the Laplace Equation as the steady-state heat equation.</p>
<p>Instead of calculating where the system will be at some time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, we will iteratively solve for <span class="math inline">\(p_{i,j}^n\)</span> until it meets a condition that we specify. The system will reach equilibrium only as the number of iterations tends to <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>, but we can approximate the equilibrium state by iterating until the change between one iteration and the next is very small.</p>
<p>Let’s rearrange the discretized equation, solving for <span class="math inline">\(p_{i,j}^n\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[p_{i,j}^n = \frac{\Delta y^2(p_{i+1,j}^n+p_{i-1,j}^n)+\Delta x^2(p_{i,j+1}^n + p_{i,j-1}^n)}{2(\Delta x^2 + \Delta y^2)}\]</span></p>
<p>Using second order central-difference schemes in both directions is the most widely applied method for the Laplace operator. It is also known as the <strong>five-point difference operator</strong>, alluding to its stencil.</p>
<p>We are going to solve Laplace’s equation numerically by assuming an initial state of <span class="math inline">\(p = 0\)</span> everywhere. Then we add boundary conditions as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(p = 0\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(x = 0\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(p = y\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(x = 2\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\\Delta p}{\\Delta y} = 0\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(y = 0, 1\)</span></p>
<p>Under these conditions, there is an analytical solution for Laplace’s equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[p(x,y)=\frac{x}{4}-4\sum_{n=1,odd}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n\pi)^2\sinh2n\pi}\sinh n\pi x\cos n\pi y\]</span></p>
<p>Define the initial parameters</p>

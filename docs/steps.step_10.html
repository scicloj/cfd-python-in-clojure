<p><link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.10/dist/katex.min.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"> For a moment, recall the Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible fluid, where <span class="math inline">\(\vec{v}\)</span> represents the velocity field:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray*}
\nabla \cdot\vec{v} &amp;=&amp; 0 \\
\frac{\partial \vec{v}}{\partial t}+(\vec{v}\cdot\nabla)\vec{v} &amp;=&amp; -\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p + \nu \nabla^2\vec{v}
\end{eqnarray*}\]</span></p>
<p>The first equation represents mass conservation at constant density. The second equation is the conservation of momentum. But a problem appears: the continuity equation for incompressible flow does not have a dominant variable, and there is no obvious way to couple the velocity and the pressure. In the case of compressible flow, in contrast, mass continuity would provide an evolution for the density <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>, which is coupled with an equation of state relating <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>In incompressible flow, the continuity equation <span class="math inline">\(\nabla \cdot\vec{v}=0\)</span> provides a <em>kinematic constraint</em> that requires the pressure field to evolve so that the rate of expansion <span class="math inline">\(\nabla \cdot\vec{v}\)</span> should vanish everywhere. A way out of this difficulty is to <em>construct</em> a pressure field that guarantees continuity is satisfied; such a relation can be obtained by taking the divergence of the momentum equation. In that process, a Poisson equation for the pressure shows up.</p>
<p>Poisson’s equation is obtained from adding a source term to the right-hand-side of Laplace’s equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial ^2 p}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial ^2 p}{\partial y^2} = b\]</span></p>
<p>So, unlike the Laplace equation, there is some finite value inside the field that affects the solution. Poisson’s equation acts to “relax” the initial source in the field.</p>
<p>In discretized form, this looks almost the same as <a href="./steps.step_09.html">Step 9</a>, except for the source term:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{p_{i+1,j}^{n}-2p_{i,j}^{n}+p_{i-1,j}^{n}}{\Delta x^2}+\frac{p_{i,j+1}^{n}-2 p_{i,j}^{n}+p_{i,j-1}^{n}}{\Delta y^2}=b_{i,j}^{n}\]</span></p>
<p>As before, we rearrange this so that we obtain an equation for <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> at point <span class="math inline">\(i, j\)</span>. Thus, we obtain:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[p_{i,j}^{n}=\frac{(p_{i+1,j}^{n}+p_{i-1,j}^{n})\Delta y^2+(p_{i,j+1}^{n}+p_{i,j-1}^{n})\Delta x^2-b_{i,j}^{n}\Delta x^2\Delta y^2}{2(\Delta x^2+\Delta y^2)}\]</span></p>
<p>We will solve this equation by assuming an initial state of <span class="math inline">\(p = 0\)</span> everywhere, and applying boundary conditions as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(p = 0\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(x = 0, 2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y = 0, 1\)</span></p>
<p>and the source term consists of two initial spikes inside the domain, as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(b_{i,j}=100\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(i=\frac{1}{4}nx, j=\frac{1}{4}ny\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(b_{i,j}=-100\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(i=\frac{3}{4}nx, j=\frac{3}{4}ny\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(b_{i,j}=0\)</span> everywhere else.</p>
<p>The iterations will advance in pseudo-time to relax the initial spikes. The relaxation under Poisson’s equation gets slower and slower as they pregress. <em>Why?</em></p>

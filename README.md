# CFD in Clojure

## What is it & Objectives
This project hopes to be a step stone to build a Computational Fluid Dynamics(CFD) tool in Clojure
by converting learning material of [CFDPython](https://github.com/barbagroup/CFDPython) into Clojure as a start. 

A main objective of the CFD Python was to teach undergrad students to learn fundamentals of CFD. 
However weâ€™d like to take this material to start building CFD as a tool for more future practical use.

## CFD
Computational Fluid Dynamics, or CFD, involves the use of numerical methods that analyze and 
predict how fluids move. To do this, CFD discretizes the spatial and temporal domains of 
a fluid into manageable computational elements.

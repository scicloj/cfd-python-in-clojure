Rough porting work has been completed. Any python specific contents from [the CFDPython](https://github.com/barbagroup/CFDPython)
didn't get ported. 
### What's left:
- Add helpful links for specific science or mathematics concepts to help people to understand the project easily
- Code optimization to make simulation runs more performant in general
- Followup for the point above: Integrate with high performance computing libraries
- Add specs to make the code more readable and debuggable
